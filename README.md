# Traffic Light Automation using YOLO - Personal Project
At traffic light intersections, when traffic density is high, the default light duration is around 60 seconds - this balances between clearing the main flow and not delaying the opposite direction too long.
However, when traffic density is light - imagine there’s only one person waiting at a red light and the minimum red time is still about 20 seconds - this becomes inefficient. To optimize, I propose an algorithm that skips unnecessary red time and instead calculates the green light duration based on the average number and type of waiting vehicles (e.g., motorbike: 3s, car: 4s, truck/bus: 5s) from the two opposite lanes currently waiting at the red light.

### Example:
At a four-way intersection (East-West-SouthNorth; East-West are opposite, South-North are opposite), the light cycle is green → yellow → red. 
When the North-South green light ends and turns yellow, the camera on the East-West lane detects and counts the number of waiting vehicles and calculates the green time based on the average vehicle type. When the East-West green light ends and turns yellow, the camera on the North-South lane does the same - and the cycle continues.
